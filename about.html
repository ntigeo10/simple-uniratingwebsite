        <h2 class="about">About This Website</h2>
        <p class="about_text">This website is a web application that allows you to rate any University you want. (Doesn't matter if it is
            a real one or an imaginary one.) Once you press the little green button at the Home page, you will be redirected to the Rate page. There,
        you will notice that there is the University Name textbox, where you will put your university's name and a lot of dropdown lists.
        Do not worry, each dropdown list has a limited amount of options. Once you selected every value, click the green button and you will get the results.
        </p>
        <p class ="about_text">The results will be displayed in borders, with each SDG having its own border. You will get results for each SDG score, plus info if the
            University needs to improve or not. Each SDG score has its own value that the university has to pass to be considered improve, which will be displayed inside the border
            right after the result. For example, you will get "The university has not been improved since 2022. SDG1 < 1.764" if the score of SDG1 is lower than 1.764.
        </p>
        <p class="about_text"> At the end of page, you will find the summary of each SDG score.</p>
